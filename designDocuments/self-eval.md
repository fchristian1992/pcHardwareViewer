| Explanation of scale                        | Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts. This might mean we haven't covered the topic yet, work is incomplete, or work contains too many issues to justify correcting each one. | Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but some significant gaps remain. Needs more work.                                                  | Understanding of the concepts is evident through correct work, and clear documentation.
