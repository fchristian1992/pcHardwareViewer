# Weekly Reflections

### Week 4
Monday and Tuesday I spent watching all the lecture videos related to Hibernate.
I think I understand it? Mostly? Wednesday I've spent working on the problem 
statement, and user stories. Thursday and Friday was spent doing the wire frames 
for the web pages of the application. Design work is not my forte in the 
slightest and I struggle with it immensely, both in doing it and staying 
motivated to do it.

### Week 5
Monday and Tuesday was spent creating all the database tables for each hardware
component. The rest of the week was spent creating all the javabean classes for
each database table.
